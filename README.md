##### Description:
This web application designed to manage the finances of a local improv club in Toronto. This club meets weekly for practice sessions, led by a coach, and consists of multiple members who have the flexibility to attend or not attend each session. Members are able to register for classes through the app and are required to pay $10 per class to attended, with the option to pay for up to one month in advance.

The app's primary functions include tracking member attendance, recording payments, tracking member payments, and handling coach payments. Additionally, it provides features for sending practice reminders to members and issuing payment reminders to those who are overdue.

##### Main Features:
    Member Management: Keep track of club members, their contact information, and attendance history.
    Financial Tracking: Record payments made by members for each practice session, including advance payments and any applicable discounts.
    Reminders: Send practice reminders to members, including notifications for regular and ad hoc sessions. Additionally, issue payment reminders to members with outstanding balances.
    Class Sign Up: Members sign up for classes with the option to pay up front or pay later.
